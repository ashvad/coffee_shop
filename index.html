        altering levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain.Regular coffee consumption may be linked to a lower
        risk of developing type 2 diabetes over the long term.Some research suggests that drinking coffee could help
        protect against Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and cognitive decline.Coffee could help support weight
        management and may be linked to decreased body fat. One study also found that people who consumed coffee were
        more likely to be physically active. Several studies have found that coffee could be linked to a lower risk of
        depression and may even be linked to a lower risk of death by suicide.Coffee consumption could be linked to a
        decreased risk of death from chronic liver disease, along with other conditions, like liver scarring and liver
        cancer.Some research shows that drinking coffee could be linked to a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, and
        heart failure.Coffee could be associated with a lower risk of death, regardless of other factors, like age,
        weight status, or alcohol consumption. Still, more research is needed.Coffee could improve physical performance
        and endurance when consumed before exercising. However, some studies have turned up mixed results.</p>

    A cappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink that originated in Austria with later development taking place in
    Italy, and is prepared with steamed milk foam. Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk,
    using non-dairy milk substitutes and flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate powder.

    Espresso is a coffee-brewing method of Italian origin, in which a small amount of nearly boiling water is forced
    under 9–10 bars of pressure through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso coffee can be made with a wide variety of
    coffee beans and roast degrees.

    A flat white is a coffee drink consisting of espresso with microfoam. It is comparable to a latte, but smaller in
    volume and with less microfoam, therefore having a higher proportion of coffee to milk.

    A long black is a style of coffee commonly found in Australia and New Zealand. It is similar to an Americano, but
    with a stronger aroma and taste. A long black is made by pouring a double-shot of espresso or ristretto over hot
    water.

<div id="z">
    Doppio espresso (Italian pronunciation: [ˈdoppjo]) is a double shot which is extracted using double the amount of
    ground coffee in a larger-sized portafilter basket. This results in 60 ml (2.1 imp fl oz; 2.0 US fl oz) of drink,
    double the amount of a single shot espresso. Doppio is Italian multiplier, meaning "double".
